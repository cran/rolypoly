#' Simulated expression data.
#'
#' A dataset containing simulated expression data for
#'  use in the rolypoly vignette.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 1000 rows and 5 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Liver}{simulated expression data for tissue. This tissue has a significant effect on the simulated gwas.}
#'   \item{Adrenal.Gland}{simulated expression data for tissue}
#'   \item{Blood}{simulated expression data for tissue. This tissue has a significant effect on the simulated gwas.}
#'   \item{Heart}{simulated expression data for tissue}
#'   \item{Lung}{simulated expression data for tissue}
#' }
#' @source I generated this dataset
